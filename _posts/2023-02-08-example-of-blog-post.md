During the winter vacation, I traveled to Tokyo, the capital of Japan.

#### DAY 1
**Roppongi,** I didn't expect much about Tokyo Tower, but thanks to the pretty lighting, the night view was so pretty that I took a lot of pictures.

<br />
<br />

#### DAY 2
**Disney Land,** I was happy to see Cinderella Castle in person, which I only saw in pictures. The rides were not very interesting, but it was impressive that the entire theme park was beautifully decorated. Personally, Universal Studio was more fun.

##### DAY 3
**Kamakura,** I went there because I heard it is famous for being the background of slam dunk. As expected, the place in the cartoon was a famous photo spot and there were so many people. Enoden running along the sea was a picturesque place.

<br />

#### DAY 4
**Senso-ji,** The temple was bigger than I imagined, so I felt a great sense of pressure. I could have experienced more Japanese culture while looking around the stores in kimono or yukata, but I was really sorry that I didn't have much time.
